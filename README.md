# Semester Long Project 2025 - Introduction to Coding

## About
This GitHub repository contains all content related to sheCodes's Introduction to Coding Semester-Long Project (SLP) team, and highlights all the work done by each of the teammates individually and collaboratively. Here, you can see projects done to enhance learning from each of the team members, and also access the final collaborative project, GameHub, where each team member contributed a unique playable game. 

The main goal of our SLP team was to introduce concepts of programming in a setting to encourage personal exploration and growth. Team members were taught basics of Python programming syntax and data structures, encouraged to do their own outside research through videos and online learning applications, as well as reach out to the team lead and other team members when needed.
